# NFNet Test version

Some demonstrations and tutorials:
1. Demo_1_Model a continuous Hamiltonian
2. Demo_2_Compare_Runtimes
3. Demo_3_Multi_Layer_Circuit
4. Demo_4_Born_Machine
5. Demo_5_MaxCut
6. Demo_6_196_qubit_Pattern_Recognition

Using the non-interacting Fermionic Formalism to efficiently simulate the measurements on a quantum circuit in polynomial time of the number of qubits, without the nearest-neighbor constraint, NFNet is a classical simulation platform of quantum systems composed of these three Hamiltonians: IZ+ZI, XX+YY, and XY+YX.
